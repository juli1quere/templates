  [#13](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/issues/13)

### New Features

_None_

### Internal Changes

_None_

## 1.0.0

_The templates tagged with this version are the ones embedded in SwiftGen 4.2._

### Internal Changes

* Initial tagging of templates as part of being split in their own repository.  
* Templates are now linted and unit-tested, to ensure the code generated compiles properly.

  [#5](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/issues/5)
  [#6](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/issues/6)
  [#15](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/pull/15)
  [#16](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/pull/16)

### Bug Fixes

* Use `escapeReservedKeywords` in all templates — to ensure compilation even for scenes named with a reserved keyword.

  [#3](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/issues/3)
  [#14](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/pull/14)
* Storyboards templates don't `import` your app module anymore, removing that annoying warning.  
  [@djbe](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#19](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/pull/19)
  * It works by checking the environment variable `PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME`, which is automatically injected by Xcode if you run `swiftgen` as part of a Script Build Phase in your Xcode project.
  * If you don't use `swiftgen` in a Script Build Phase of your Xcode project but manually in the terminal, you can instead use  `swiftgen storyboards --param module=YourAppModuleName …` when invoking SwiftGen to inject it manually instead.

### New Features

* Use an explicit bundle parameter to support frameworks for all templates.

  [@djbe](https://github.com/djbe)
  [#7](https://github.com/SwiftGen/templates/issues/7)

## Pre-1.0.0

_See SwitftGen's own CHANGELOG pre SwiftGen 4.2 version, before the refactoring that led us to split the code in frameworks_

### Deprecations

Note that in preparation for the upcoming SwiftGen 5.0, some variables available in the SwiftGen's Stencil templates have been deprecated and will be renamed. To prepare for SwiftGen 5.0, **we strongly advise to migrate your custom templates so they use the new variables** (already available in SwiftGen 4.2 / SwiftGenKit 1.0.1) instead of the old ones, so that they will continue to work in SwiftGen 5.0

See [the migration guide in SwiftGen's wiki](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen/wiki/Migration-Guides).
